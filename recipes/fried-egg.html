        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Fried Egg is one of God's most perfect creations. I think it's the best food in the world. One time I was eating 2 eggs a day and threw up on the 30th day of doing this. That is how dedicated I am.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs (as many as you like)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack your eggs into a bowl and stir with a fork until the whites are mixed with the yellow. </li>
            <li>Warm your skillet and put about 1tbsp of oil in there.</li>
            <li>Put your egg in the warm skillet and oil.</li>
            <li>Wait for it to solidify a little, I'd cook it on low if this is your first time.</li>
            <li>Eat it! So good!!</li>
        </ol>
