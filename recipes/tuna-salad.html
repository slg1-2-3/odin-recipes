    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tuna salad is a smelly yet satisfying dish for people who like to eat high protein foods. Personally, the aroma of canned tuna doesn't bother me, but be considerate of others who do mind the smell. You'll need some canned or pouched tuna, eggs, pickled jalapenos, mayo, mustard, salt, pepper, paprika, and bread if you would like to put it on a sandwich</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your eggs in cold water and boil for 20 minutes. You can also put vinegar in the water but I don't think it does anything</li>
        <li>Mince onion and serrano or jalapeno and put into your bowl </li>
        <li>Add tuna, mayo, mustard, and pickled jalapeno or pickles to your bowl</li>
        <li>Eggs should be done boiling by now, get them out of the water and start peeling. Separate the yolks and toss them into your bowl with everything</li>
        <li>Dice your egg whites. And add to bowl</li>
        <li>Add your seasonings to taste</li>
    </ol>
